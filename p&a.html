<h1>Languages & Traveling</h1>
<p class="about11">
Faor the past few years, I have been in love with two languages: French because of my Haitian roots, and Latin, yes the dead language, because of my love for mythology. For five years, I studied Latin and translated texts (starting with Ecce Romani, and ending with Vergil's Aeneid). My favorite texts were probably Daedalus and Icarus and The Aeneid. For the past six years, I have been studying French. In the future, I would love to go to France and fully immerse myself into its beautiful language.
In the future, I would love to be fluent in French, Italian, ASL, Arabic, and German.
</p>

<p class="about12">In the spring break of my junior year, I will be going to Italy. This is due to my dedication to Latin. 
The summer before my senior year, I would love to do a French or Italian immersion program.  
While in college, I would like to broaden my horizons by participating in a study abroad program that would take place in a country where I can interact with people who speak my target language.</p>

<p class="about13">
In the past, I have gone to Costa Rica and London because of my school. The trip took place in the spring break of 8th grade. In preparation for the trip, I had to do resaerch. I was assigned different animals and plants, and we had to type a paper on them that described things like their life cycles, sexual dichotomy, coloring, and size. I still remember my plant, the bird of paradise, and whenever I see the flower, I instant recall my trip. In Costa Rica, we got to see volcanoes, go hiking, see our plants and animals, and my favorite, hear howler monkies in the morning. In London, a place where all 9th graders got to go, we did all thhe touristy things: went one the London Eye, toured Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's Cathedral. My favourite aspect of the trip was the fact that beforehend, we were assigned a painting in the National Gallery, and while there, were got to give five minutes presentations in front of our actual paintings. I loved both of the trips for two different reasons: Costa Rica because I got to see a completely different culture founded on loving/ taking care of nature and Pura Vida, and London because it was a city so like and so different from mine, and I got to see it with my friends.</p>

<h3>Volunteering</h3>
<p class="abou31">
All of the volunteering that I've done outside of school has had to do with tutoring underprivileged children. I have worked with the Sisulu Walker School, the South Bronx Latin Club, and the Boys' Club of New York City. I focus on children because, although it may sound cheesy and unoriginal, I truly believe that education is key. Every new piece of information you learn broadens your horizons and enriches your life. Whenever I understand a concept that seemed confusing and tricky at first, I feel so proud and accomplished; I love being able to help other children feel the same way whenever I explain an equation or grammar rule to them.
</p>


<h2>Coding</h2>
<p class="about21">My interest in coding is very fresh, but I love it. As of now (summer before my junior year), I only have some knowledge in Html, Css, and Javascript. I gained my skills at <a href="https://nycda.com/">The New York Code & Design Academy</a> through a four week summer program. I looked for a coding school because I knew and still know that coding is a successful and fulfilling career. I wanted to start, but I didn't know how, so I looked for a program that would teach me. Now that the program's over, I have watched videos and done research to fill in the gaps of what I don't know. I have also been doing projects, like making this portfolio and coding pages that match other websites (so I know how to code different types of websites and actions).</p>
